## Want to say thank you? {#thank-you}

Well, thank *you*!
You could:

- [Send me an email!]({{< relref "/contact" >}})
  Seriously, if this material helped you, it will make my day to know.
  I love hearing from readers, and you'll almost certainly get a message back from me.

- [Contribute financially.](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ejmastnak)
  Based on reader input, there are in fact people out there interested in compensating me financially for my tutorials.
  That's awesome---thank you!
