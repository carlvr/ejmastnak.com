    <h1 class="text-3xl">About me</h1>

    <p class="mt-5">
      Here is <a href="/resume.pdf" class="link">my résumé</a> and <a href="/contact/" class="link">contact info</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-4">
      And here is some information about me:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-3 space-y-3 ml-5 list-disc">

      <li>
        I'm <strong class="font-medium">Slovene-American</strong> and grew up between New York, Ljubljana, and California.
      </li>

      <li>
        I went to <strong class="font-medium">high school in Orange County, California</strong> and returned to <strong class="font-medium">Slovenia for university</strong>, where I completed a bachelor's degree in physics at the University of Ljubljana.
      </li>

      <li>
        <p class="">
          I <strong class="font-medium">work professionally on</strong> programmatically extracting useful information from biomechanical time series data at <a href="https://www.tmg-bodyevolution.com/" class="link">TMG-BMC</a>, a biomechanics and kinesiology company that makes non-invasive sensors for quantifying muscle function in professional athletes and medical patients.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          From high-school graduation onwards I've also worked as a tutor, both officially and freelancing, to help people learn physics, math, and scientific computing.
          Lately I've been learning to build websites and web applications with an eye on part-time freelancing.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong class="font-medium">Hobbies include:</strong> just about any physical activity (here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRuRQaAUP0w" class="link">90-second workout video</a> from when I was training football/soccer seriously), food and cooking, teaching and watching people learn, power-user software in the Linux ecosystem, building things, growing food, being outside, time with friends and family.
        In the spring of 2023 I discovered Cuban salsa, aka Casino, and quickly became obsessed—you can now find me most Friday nights at CubanaLJ in Ljubaljana :)

    <h1 class="text-3xl">About this website</h1>

    <ul class="mt-4 space-y-3 ml-5 list-disc">

      <li>
        <p>The website is a static site built with the <a href="https://gohugo.io/" class="link">Hugo</a> static site generator.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">
          Long-form tutorial articles are written in Markdown; 
          standalone pages, and components like the navigation menu and footer, are written in HTML for finer-grained control over design.
          A sprinkling of vanilla JavaScript is used to implement the mobile navigation bar and the dark/light theme switcher, although I've done my best to make this website completely functional without JavaScript.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        I use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" class="link">Tailwind CSS</a> for styling, and the font used on this site is <a href="https://github.com/rsms/inter" class="link">Inter</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        The website is hosted on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" class="link">Netlify</a>.
      </li>

      <li>
        The website's source code is <a href="https://github.com/ejmastnak/ejmastnak.com" class="link">available on GitHub</a>;
        here is the <a href="/license" class="link">license</a> if you want to reuse or adapt the website.
