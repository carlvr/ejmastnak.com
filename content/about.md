# About

(Here is [my résumé](/resume.pdf) and [contact info]({{< relref "/contact.md" >}}).)

<!-- And here is some information about me: -->
Otherwise, if you're curious, I...

- am **Slovene-American** and grew up between New York, Ljubljana and California.

- went to **high school in Orange County, California** and returned to **Slovenia for university**, where I completed a bachelor's degree in **physics** at the University of Ljubljana.

- enjoy **sharing technical tutorials** and efficient workflows on this website.

- **work professionally on** extracting useful information from biomechanical time series data at [TMG-BMC](https://www.tmg-bodyevolution.com/), a biomechanics and kinesiology company that makes non-invasive sensors for quantifying muscle function in professional athletes and medical patients.

  I also build web applications, make websites, and help people learn physics and scientific computing.

- enjoy just about any physical activity---if you're interested, here's a cool [90-second workout video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0XI5gKkk5A) from when I was training seriously.
  
  I also enjoy cooking, building things, graphic design, teaching, growing food, being outside, and of course the company of friends and family.
