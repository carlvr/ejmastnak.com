# Convolutional Neural Networks and Particle Physics

This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks for classifying the products of high-energy collisions produced in particle physics experiments like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and was written in the scope of *Seminar* course requirements at the Faculty of Math and Physics at the University of Ljubljana.
